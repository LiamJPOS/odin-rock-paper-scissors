remove logic that plays exactly 5 rounds
    so just play forever to start with
create 3 buttons for user to make their selection
    add an event listener that calls playRound function when a button is pressed
    Needs to include correct playerSelection
create display for running score
end game when someone hits 5 points
turn console logs into DOM methods
    I like the 2 windows for user and comuter selection
    3 buttons under It
    console logs at the bottom maybe doesnt need to be pretty
        although good to keep in practice
when game ends clear the screen and write who won
